        <p>The Akan Name Generator is a cultural web application designed to help users discover their traditional Akan name. 
            In the Akan culture of Ghana, names are deeply rooted in the day of the week a person is born and their gender. 
            Each day corresponds to a specific name for males and females, and these names often reflect traits or meanings 
            associated with that day.
            This web tool allows you to input your birthdate and select your gender. Using a built-in formula, the app calculates 
            the day of the week you were born and assigns you the corresponding Akan name. Its a fun and educational way to 
            explore Ghanaian traditions and learn more about your own identity or that of friends and family.
            Whether you're simply curious or have a cultural interest, this app is an easy and interactive way to connect with 
            an important part of West African heritage.

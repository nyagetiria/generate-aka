# Akan-Name

## Description
The Akan Name Generator is a user-friendly website that helps you discover your traditional Akan name based on your birthdate and gender. In Akan culture (primarily in Ghana), names are given according to the day of the week a person is born. This web app calculates the day of the week from your input and presents you with your culturally significant name.

Whether you're curious about Ghanaian traditions or just want to explore a fun way to learn about names and birthdays, this tool offers a simple and engaging experience for all users.
